# rosreader
This app is intended to parse 40k roster files and show the data in a compressed format that's easier to reference during a game.  All stats and info should be included, but unit and weapon counts, as well as power level and points, are inconsistent and can be toggled from the settings menu in the upper right.  Other controls are as follows:

 - detachment info and army rules are on the first page, the remaining pages show units
 - click on the unit name at the top of the screen to bring up a clickable list of all units
 - click on the button in the upper right to toggle features or bring up a clickable list of roster files
 - swipe left and right to scroll through units
 - click on the button at the bottom of a unit's page to show powers and abilities
 
The app will only find roster files in the download folder.  The easiest way to get them there seems to be to share them and then download them.
